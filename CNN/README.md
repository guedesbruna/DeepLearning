# Assignment 3

Implementation of various types of classifiers for MNIST data. 

- Q1-Q3.py, contains pseudocode for defining a non-vectorized implementation of the convolution operation 
- Q6.py, contains a convolution operation implemented from scratch as a PyTorch function
- Q7-Q9.ipynb, contains a fixed resolution classifier with 28x28 input on MNIST data, with hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation
- Q10-Q14.ipynb, contains a fixed resolution classifier with variable resolution MNIST data resized to 28x28, with data augmentation
- Q15-Q17_fixed_res.ipynb, contains a fixed resolution classifier with variable resolution MNIST data, with hyperparameter tuning
- Q15-Q17_var_res.ipynb, contains a variable resolution classifier, with Global Max Pooling, Global Mean Pooling, and hyperparameter tuning

Code written by Bruna Aguiar Guedes, Enrico Calleris, and Romy Vos, unless otherwise specified.
