# Assignment 4A

Build Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating images of MNIST and SVHN.

- VAE_Basic.ipynb, contains an implementation of a VAE with Gaussian Prior 
- VAE_Priors.ipynb, contains an implementation of a VAE with two different priors, Gaussian and flow-based (RealNVP), with generation of images and interpolation
- GAN.ipynb, contains an implementation of a GAN on MNIST and SVHN

Code written by Bruna Aguiar Guedes, Enrico Calleris, Romy Vos, unless otherwise specified.
